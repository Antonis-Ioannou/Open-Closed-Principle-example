# Open-Closed-Principle-example (OCP)
OCP states that a software entity (classes/functions etc) should be closed for modification but open for extention, 
meaning an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

In my example, the interfaces set the rules, and alongside with the "employees" class, I can add as many different "Accounts" 
I want, without modifying the source code.
